- 👋 Hi, I’m Pedro
- 👀 I’m interested in developing websites using React and NextJS in an environment designed with Tailwind CSS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming, design, content management, deployment and database manipulation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on real projects, I have already started a handful of projects for practicing and, eventually, deployment.
- 📫 How to reach me: send me a message through GitHub and I will reply when I am able to.
